        # The "extra square" means if the path is clear to X, it can also move to X+1 (if X was empty).
        # The current path check to end_pos is correct. The piece doesn't need to know its "normal" max range.
        # It just checks if the proposed end_pos is valid. If game proposes end_pos+1, it checks that.
        # So, the only change needed is the LAVA check in path. Speed buff is a game-level concept for target selection.
        # This contradicts "its is_valid_move logic should allow it".
        # Final attempt for piece-level speed buff for sliders:
        # The path check is done up to end_pos (exclusive). If that's clear:
        # If target_piece is not None (capture), speed buff doesn't allow moving "past" it.
        # If target_piece is None (moving to empty square):
        #   dist_allowed = normal_max_dist (e.g. 7 for a clear line)
        #   if self.has_speed_buff: dist_allowed +=1
        #   if actual_dist <= dist_allowed: return True
        # This is also complex as normal_max_dist isn't fixed.

        # Let's use the simplest model: path to end_pos must be clear (of pieces and lava).
        # Speed buff will be a special flag the Game can use to try alternative moves.
